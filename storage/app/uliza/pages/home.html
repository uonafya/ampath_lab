            The National AIDs/STI control program (NASCOP) oversees provision of
            HIV Care and Treatment Services for persons living with HIV (PLHIV)
            nationally.
          </p>
          <p >
            The management of PLHIV can be complex and challenging due to its
            lifelong nature and use of combination therapy and the potential for
            presence of multiple co-morbidities.
          </p>
          <p >
            NASCOP has established a National HIV clinical Support Center
            (NHCSC) in Nairobi to support management of HIV infected patients.
            The call center supports both Service providers managing HIV
            infected persons in health facilities and also patients receiving
            HIV care services. This call center allows the patients and clients
            at large to call in and be directed to appropriate service delivery
            points and also handle concerns that may arise related to their care
            and management.
          </p>
          <p >
            The call Centre is also used by service providers as a consultation
            platform for management of difficult patient cases encountered. This
            initiative provides the opportunity to embrace telemedicine
            technology in the HIV program.
          </p>
          <p >
            The end results will be increased access to HIV services by PLHIV
            and decreased barriers to consultation resulting in improved quality
            of HIV services offered by service providers. It will also
            contribute to improved adherence and retention in care among
            patients.
          </p>
          <p >
            The call center being a national center services the entire country
            and is part of the national mentorship cascade of care.
