          <p >Uliza is a Swahili word that means “ask”.</p>
          <p >
            This is a clinician’s support platform within the National HIV
            clinical support Centre (NHCSC), which has 2 arms:
          </p>

          <ul >
            <li >Email consultation (ulizanascop@gmail.com)</li>
            <li >Phone consultation (0800724848).</li>
          </ul>
          <p ></p>
          <p >
            In the Email consultation, this is where clinicians can send it
            difficult cases (Treatment failure, comorbidities, adverse drug
            reactions etc.) for recommendation by the expert Team.
          </p>
          <p >
            The phone consultation on the hand is where the clinicians are able
            to call using a toll-free line and make inquiries. The 2 platforms
            run on a web-based platform that is hosted at NASCOP.
