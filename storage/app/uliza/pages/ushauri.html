        Patients receive three categories of messages in either English or
        Swahili:
      </p>

      <ul >
        <li >
          Educative and motivational messages: dispatched on weekly intervals
        </li>
        <li >
          Appointment reminders: sent seven days and 24 hours prior to client’s
          appointment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p >
        We are looking to achieve universal access to SMS notification service
        while being mindful of patient confidentiality. Therefore, written
        consent is obtained prior to enrollment into the service.
